# Surfs_up
> Module 9 Challenge D3

## Overview of the analysis:

A business plan requires more information about temperature trends before the opening of the surf shop in Hawaii. More importantly, we need temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* All stats of December temps are lower than their counterparts of June.
* Deviation of the two months are about 3 ~5 degrees, which is considerably narrow. 
* Standard-Deviation is about 3 degrees for both months, which is quite stable.

In conclusion, it is quite stable on the weather aspect influencing the business.

## Summary

Based on the outcomes of this analysis, it's not hard to find out that the summer-winter temperature was stable enough to provide a linear number of customers.
2 queries to find co-relation between temps and prcps. 
Findings: Peak prcp happens at 70 degrees both in June and December.
